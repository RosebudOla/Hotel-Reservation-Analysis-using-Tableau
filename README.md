# Findings and Insights
1) Percentage of Bookings for Each Hotel:City Hotel: 66.4% Resort Hotel: 33.5%, Percentage of Repeated Guests for Each Hotel:City Hotel: 53.2% Resort Hotel: 46.7%, Percentage of Canceled Bookings for Each Hotel:City Hotel: 74.8% Resort Hotel: 25.1%. These show that City hotel has more bookings and repeated guests than Resort hotel, however bookings are least canceled in Resort hotel than in City hotel which has a very high rate of cancellation.
2) The top 10 booking countries which include Portugal (PRT), the United Kingdom (GBR), France (FRA), Spain (ESP), and Germany (DEU) are all European countries indicating a strong european presence except for Brazil which also suggests an international appeal.
3) A larger number of adults stay at the City hotel (146,838) compared to the Resort hotel (74,798) suggesting that the City hotel may cater more to adult travelers, possibly including business travelers, couples, or groups of friends while the Resort hotel has a higher number of children and babies and this indicates that the Resort may appeal more to families seeking leisure-oriented accommodations or amenities such as kid's clubs, pools, or family-friendly activities. The higher number of children and babies at the resort suggests a family-friendly environment and may influence the types of services and facilities offered.
4) Both hotels exhibit seasonal fluctuations in ADR, with peak periods occurring during summer months for the Resort hotel and in October, September, and May for the City hotel, reflecting seasonal demand patterns and market dynamics.
5) Transient guests represent the largest segment of bookings, followed by transient party guests, contract bookings, and group bookings, highlighting the importance of catering to diverse guest segments and tailoring services accordingly.
6) Bookings from online travel agencies (TO) dominate, suggesting a strong presence and reliance on online distribution channels for attracting guests thereby indicating the importance of partnerships with online travel platforms and digital marketing efforts to drive bookings. Followed by offline travel agents/operators (TA/TO), group bookings, direct bookings, corporate bookings, complementary bookings, and aviation bookings.
7) Cancellation rates vary across quarters, with the City hotel experiencing higher cancellation rates compared to the Resort hotel, this could be influenced by market segmentation, cancellation policies, seasonal demand fluctuations, booking channels, and revenue management strategies.

# Recommendations
1) Different customer segments may have unique preferences and requirements, necessitating customized service offerings and amenities. By segmenting guests based on customer type, the hotel can personalize guest experiences, anticipate needs, and enhance overall satisfaction
2) Effective communication with guests regarding reservation status, cancellation policies, and check-in procedures can help reduce cancellations, mitigate no-shows, and enhance guest satisfaction. Proactive engagement with guests through personalized communication channels, pre-arrival messages, and loyalty programs can foster guest loyalty and drive repeat bookings.
3) Develop targeted marketing campaigns tailored to the top booking countries, focusing on cultural nuances, language preferences, and travel trends to attract and retain international guests
4) Adjust pricing based on seasonal demand to attract more guests during peak times and maintain competitiveness during slow periods.
5) Offer flexible cancellation policies to accommodate guest needs while protecting revenue
